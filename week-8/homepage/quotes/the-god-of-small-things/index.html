            He was exasperated because he didn't know what that look meant. He put it somewhere between indifference and despair. He
            didn't know that in some places, like the country that Rahel came from, various kinds of despair competed for primacy.
            And that personal despair could never be desperate enough. That something happened when personal turmoil dropped by at
            the wayside shrine of the vast, violent, circling, driving, ridiculous, insane, unfeasible, public turmoil of a nation.
            That Big God howled like a hot wind, and demanded obeisance. Then Small God (cozy and contained, private and limited)
            came away cauterized, laughing numbly at his own temerity. Inured by the confirmation of his own inconsequence, he
            became resilient and truly indifferent. Nothing mattered much. Nothing much mattered. And the less it mattered, the less
            it mattered. It was never important enough. Because Worse Things had happened. In the country that she came from, poised
            forever between the terror of war and the horror of peace, Worse Things kept happening.<br />

            In a purely practical sense it would probably be correct to say that it all began when Sophie Mol came to Ayemenem.
            Perhaps it's true that things can change in a day. That a few dozen hours can affect the outcome of whole lifetimes. And
            that when they do, those few dozen hours, like the salvaged remains of a burned house the charred clock, the singed
            photograph, the scorched furniture must be resurrected from the ruins and examined. Preserved. Accounted for.
            Little events, ordinary things, smashed and reconstituted. Imbued with new meaning. Suddenly they become the bleached
            bones of a story.<br />
            Still, to say that it all began when Sophie Mol came to Ayemenem is only one way of looking at it.<br />
            Equally, it could be argued that it actually began thousands of years ago. Long before the Marxists came. Before the
            British took Malabar, before the Dutch Ascendency, before Vasco da Gama arrived, before the Zamorin's conquest of
            Calicut. Before three purple-robed Syrian bishops murdered by the Portuguese were found floating in the sea, with coiled
            sea serpents riding on their chests and oysters knotted in their tangled beards. It could be argued that it began long
            before Christianity arrived in a boat and seeped into Kerala like tea from a tea bag.<br />
            That it really began in the days when the Love Laws were made. The laws that lay down who should be loved, and how.
            And how much.<br />

            He made them imagine that the earth-four thousand six hundred million years old-was a forty-six-year-old woman-as old,
            say, as Aleyamma Teacher, who gave them Malayalam lessons. It had taken the whole of the Earth Woman's life for the
            earth to become what it was. For the oceans to part. For the mountains to rise. The Earth Woman was eleven years old,
            Chacko said, when the first single-celled organisms appeared. The first animals, creatures like worms and jellyfish,
            appeared only when she was forty. She was over forty-five-just eight months ago-when dinosaurs roamed the earth.
            "The whole of human civilization as we know it," Chacko told the twins, "began only two hours ago in the Earth Woman's
            life. As long as it takes us to drive from Ayemenem to Cochin."<br />
            It was an awe-inspiring and humbling thought, Chacko said (Humbling was a nice word, Rahel thought. Humbling along
            without a care in the world), that the whole of contemporary history, the World Wars, the War of Dreams, the Man on the Moon,
            science, literature, philosophy, the pursuit of knowledge was no
            more than a blink of the Earth Woman's eye.<br />
            "And we, my dears, everything we are and ever will be are just a twinkle in her eye," Chacko said grandly, lying on his
            bed, staring at the ceiling.<br />

            Back inside the hairoil darkness, Estha held his Other Hand carefully (upwards, as though he was holding an imagined
            orange). He slid past the Audience (their legs moving thiswayandthat), past Baby Kochamma, past Rahel (still tilted
            back), past Ammu (still annoyed). Estha sat down, still holding his sticky orange.<br />
            And there was Baron von Clapp-Trapp. Christopher Plummer. Arrogant. Hardhearted. With a mouth like a slit. And a
            steelshrill police whistle. A captain with seven children. Clean children, like a packet of peppermints. He pretended
            not to love them, but he did. He loved them. He loved her (Julie Andrews), she loved him, they loved the children, the
            children loved them. They all loved each other. They were clean, white children, and their beds were soft with Ei. Der.
            Downs.<br />
            The house they lived in had a lake and gardens, a wide staircase, white doors and windows, and curtains with flowers.
            The clean white children, even the big ones, were scared of the thunder. To comfort them, Julie Andrews put them all
            into her clean bed, and sang them a clean song about a few of her favorite things. These were a few of her favorite
            things:<br /><br />

            (1) Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes.<br />
            (2) Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings.<br />
            (3) Bright copper kettles.<br />
            (4) Doorbells and sleighbells and schnitzel with noodles.<br />
            (5) Etc.<br />
