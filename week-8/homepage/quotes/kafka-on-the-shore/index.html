            Sometimes fate is like a small sandstorm that keeps changing direc tions. You change direction but the sandstorm chases
            you. You turn again, but the storm adjusts. Over and over you play this out, like some ominous dance with death just
            before dawn. Why? Because this storm isn't some thing that blew in from far away, something that has nothing to do with
            you. This storm is you. Something inside of you. So all you can do is give in to it, step right inside the storm,
            closing your eyes and plugging up your ears so the sand doesn't get in, and walk through it, step by step. There's no
            sun there, no moon, no direction, no sense of time. Just fine white sand swirling up into the sky like pulverized bones.
            That's the kind of sand storm you need to imagine.

            And you really will have to make it through that violent, metaphysical, symbolic storm. No matter how metaphysical or
            symbolic it might be, make no mistake about it: it will cut through flesh like a thousand razor blades. People will
            bleed there, and you will bleed too. Hot, red blood. You'll catch that blood in your hands, your own blood and the blood
            of others.<br />
            And once the storm is over you won't remember how you made it through, how you managed to survive. You won't even be
            sure, in fact, whether the storm is really over. But one thing is certain. When you come out of the storm you won't be
            the same person who walked in. That's what this storm's all about.

            I'm free, I think. I shut my eyes and think hard and deep about how free I am, but I can't really understand what it
            means. All I know is I'm totally alone. All alone in an unfamiliar place, like some solitary explorer who's lost his
            compass and his map. Is this what it means to be free? I don't know, and I give up thinking about it.

            I go back to the reading room, where I sink down in the sofa and into the world of The Arabian Nights. Slowly, like a
            movie fadeout, the real world evaporates. I'm alone, inside the world of the story. My favorite feeling in the world.

            Johnnie Walker stopped whistling. He halted his work and scratched an earlobe. "That won't fly, Mr. Nakata. I'm sorry
            you feel bad, I really am, but I can't just say, Okay, will do, and call this off. I told you. This is war. It's hard to
            stop a war once it starts. Once the sword is drawn, blood's going to be spilled. This doesn't have anything to do with
            theory or logic, or even my ego. It's just a rule, pure and simple. If you don't want any more cats to be killed, you've
            got to kill me. Stand up, focus your hatred, and strike me down. And you've got to do it now. Do that and it's all over.
            End of story.”

            "'Cause if you take every single person who lacks much imagination seri ously, there's no end to it," I say.
            "That's it," Oshima says. He taps his temple lightly with the eraser end of the pencil. "But there's one thing I want
            you to remember, Kafka. Those are the kind of people who murdered Miss Saeki's childhood sweetheart. Narrow minds devoid
            of imagination. Intolerance, theories cut off from reality, empty terminology, usurped ideals, inflexible systems. Those
            are the things that really frighten me. What I absolutely fear and loathe. Of course it's important to know what's right
            and what's wrong. Individual errors in judg ment can usually be corrected. As long as you have the courage to admit mis
            takes, things can be turned around. But intolerant, narrow minds with no imagination are like parasites that transform
            the host, change form, and con tinue to thrive. They're a lost cause, and I don't want anyone like that coming in here."
            Oshima points at the stacks with the tip of his pencil. What he means, of course, is the entire library.
            "I wish I could just laugh off people like that, but I can't.”
